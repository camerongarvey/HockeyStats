A webapp that pulls stats for team from Hisport

To use:

Step 1: Download this repository

Step 2: Install project dependencies (if unsure run app.py and follow prompts in terminal)

Step 3: Run app.py

Step 4: Select the year and team then click "Go"

Step 5: Wait... wait... wait... (I'm working on speeding it up but I promise it's loading and not just frozen)

To modify the which teams are available go to "data_source.py" and either replace or extend the directory.
